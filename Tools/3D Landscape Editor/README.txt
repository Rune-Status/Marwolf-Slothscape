===================================================================================

Double-click "MapEditor.jar" to start the editor - there are no ANT scripts to run.

Load a section; h0x51y51 is Lumbridge, this will put you into the main screen of the editor.

Despite having multiple files in the "edit" directory included, only the Landscape.rscd file is ever changed.
When you need to move your landscape file to your client it is the only file you will need to copy.

Main Screen
========================================================
The drop-down dialog menus are on the top toolbar, more on them below.

After you've loaded a coordinate the editor will load an area of 2x2 sections.

There are 3 print-outs in the top-left that show important information.
Mouse: The local coordinate of the tile your mouse is over.
World: The world coordinate of the tile your mouse is over - helpful for placing new objects.
Facing: The direction the camera is facing.

-----
Navigating the loaded sections
-----
Use WASD to move the camera, and arrow keys to rotate/zoom.

==============================================================
Using the land editor
------------------------
Change the "Mode" to "Land" from the drop-down. This will open the land editing dialog.

I really haven't made many changes to how this works yet, set up the properties you want the tile to have and click the "Apply" button.
Then when you left-click on a tile in the editor that tile will take on the properties you have set for it.

You can copy the properties of a tile into the land editor dialog by right-clicking a tile. To use these settings for another tile make sure you hit the "Apply" button.

=========================================================
Dialog Menus

Any of these buttons will move you 1 section in the direction you have chosen so you can more easily navigate the map.

Help
-----
Not much here.

================================================
Settings.ini
------------------
Not really much to mess with here.

"client_dir" - will change the working directory the editor uses to load and save the Landscape.rscd file, as well as where to load the textures, etc.

"height_y_shift" - This number is the offset the world uses to display the world coordinates when you move up and down between heights.
			It has no effects on the editor except the "World" info print-out. Doesn't need to be changed unless you are reprogramming the client.
